## 13:11:28 Fixed an issue that images in rhythmpedia.com are shown lager than the current screen

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .lightbox img {
    max-width: 500px !important;
    height: auto !important;
    display: block !important;
    margin-left: auto !important;
    margin-right: auto !important;
  }
}
```

### Q: How can you achieve to make it only woks when it is not in the mobile mode?
```
.lightbox img {
  max-width: 500px !important;
  height: auto !important;
  display: block !important;
  margin-left: auto !important;
  margin-right: auto !important;
}
```

It worked to change the default size in Quarto websites. Thank you very much for telling me how to achieve it. 

But now I noticed that it breaks when it comes the mobile mode. How can you achieve to make it only woks when it is not in the mobile mode?

### A:You can restrict the CSS rule to apply **only on larger screens (non-mobile mode)** by using a media query.
You can restrict the CSS rule to apply **only on larger screens
(non-mobile mode)** by using a media query. Hereâ€™s how to modify your
CSS:

``` css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .lightbox img {
    max-width: 500px !important;
    height: auto !important;
    display: block !important;
    margin-left: auto !important;
    margin-right: auto !important;
  }
}
```

#### âœ… What this does:

- The styles inside `@media (min-width: 768px)` will **only apply when
  the screen width is 768 pixels or larger** (i.e., tablets and
  desktops).
- On mobile devices (narrower than 768px), the image will use the
  default lightbox styles, which are typically responsive and smaller.

You can adjust `768px` to match your design breakpoint if needed (e.g.,
`640px`, `1024px`, etc.).

Let me know if you'd like to support different styles for tablets vs
desktops too.

### Q: Will it be harmonized with Quarto's responsive behavior
Will it be harmonized with Quarto's responsive behavior

### A: 
Yes â€” using a media query like `@media (min-width: 768px)` **is
harmonized with Quartoâ€™s responsive design**. Hereâ€™s why:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### âœ… Why it's safe and harmonized:

1.  **Quarto uses Bootstrap 5 by default**, which is fully responsive
    and also uses standard breakpoints like `768px`, `992px`, etc.

    - So your `@media (min-width: 768px)` rule aligns exactly with
      Bootstrap's `md` breakpoint (medium devices and up).
    - This means your override will **only apply on tablets and
      larger**, which fits well with Quartoâ€™s layout behavior.

2.  **Mobile fallback remains untouched.**

    - On mobile (below 768px), your rule **wonâ€™t apply**, and Quartoâ€™s
      built-in responsive image behavior will take over. This ensures
      images remain flexible and appropriately sized.

3.  **No layout breakage expected.**

    - Your styling just constrains image size and centers it, without
      hardcoding height or overriding container constraints.
    - This makes it **non-invasive** and safe to use alongside Quarto's
      default theme logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ðŸ§ª You can confirm it's working harmoniously by:

- Opening DevTools â†’ Emulating different screen widths
- Checking `.lightbox img` computed styles at \<768px vs â‰¥768px
- Ensuring images stay within their container and don't overflow or
  become blurry

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Optional fine-tuning:

If you want images to scale smoothly between small and large screens,
you could use a **percentage-based max-width** or clamp units:

``` css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .lightbox img {
    max-width: clamp(300px, 50%, 500px) !important;
  }
}
```

Let me know if you'd like to harmonize it further with other breakpoints
(`lg`, `xl`, etc.) or support dark mode too.
