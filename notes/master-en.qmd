These are my notes that I wrote when I was thinking about my works.

## Jazz is the Kotodama of English <!-- {#jazz-is-the-kotodama-of-english} -->

To understand English, you must feel its rhythm --- and that rhythm lives in jazz. Discover why vocabulary alone can never reveal the emotions behind English, and how Offbeat Counting opens the door to both groove and language.

### The Kotodama {#kotodama}

> ジャズは英語の言霊だ。ジャズがわかれば英語はわかる。その言葉の奥にある感情が見える様になる。逆に言えばジャズがわからなければ単語を暗記するだけに終始し単語の向こうにある感情が見えなくなる。ではジャズをわかる為にはどうすればいいか。それがオフビートカウントだ。

Jazz is the kotodama of English. If you understand jazz, you understand English. You begin to see the emotions that lie behind the words. Conversely, if you cannot understand jazz, your English study reduces to memorizing vocabulary, and the feelings behind those words remain invisible. So what must you do to understand jazz? That is where Offbeat Counting comes in.

## The Blind Spot in Japanese Perception <!-- {#blind-spot-in-japanese-perception} -->

There’s a rhythm that Japanese people can’t pick up on. Even though you can discern the pitch when listening to it in isolation, once it’s placed in a certain position, there’s a blind spot in rhythm perception where the very existence of the sound becomes unrecognizable. This is an entirely separate issue from not being able to discern pitch, and it requires dedicated corrective training.

## Be Myself <!-- {#be-myself} -->

A poem about breaking the boundaries of identity --- where self, others, and the world dissolve into a single rhythmic existence. It reveals that the world you perceive is a model inside your mind, and therefore, the world is also you.

### The Poem <!-- {#content-of-be-myself} -->

<div style="font-style:italic">
Break the rhythm. Break the limit.  
Be myself. I am me.  
Be yourself. I am you.  
Be themselves. I am them.  
Be the world. You are the world.  
Be all things. I am all things.  
Be the galaxy. I am the galaxy.  
Be the universe. I am the universe.  
Be the music. You are the music.  
</div>

### Explanation <!-- {#explanation-of-be-myself} -->
Because the world you perceive is a model constructed inside your mind, the world is you.

## The Essence of Jazz Is Rhythm Switching <!-- {#essence-of-jazz-is-rhythm-switching} -->

Jazz isn’t defined by a specific rhythm - its essence is the act of switching rhythms. Rhythm varies, but jazz itself does not. Jazz matters because it reveals the importance of rhythmic transformation; without rhythm switching, it is no longer jazz.

### It's not that rhythm is important to jazz <!-- {#its-not-that-rhythm-is-important-to-jazz} -->

It's not that rhythm is important to jazz; rather, jazz is important to rhythm. There are differences in rhythm, but there are no differences in jazz. The essence of jazz lies in switching rhythms. Jazz is not just a specific rhythm. Jazz without rhythm switching is not jazz. However, no particular rhythm defines jazz.

## Triple Offbeat-Leading Rhythm  <!-- {#triple-offbeat-leading-rhythm} -->

<!-- 2025/11/13 23:55:01 -->

The SNL shopping-skit theme uses a fully offbeat-leading, tail-to-tail rhythmic structure that feels ordinary to Americans but is nearly unrecognizable to Japanese listeners, revealing how deeply linguistic habits shape unconscious rhythmic perception.

### The Structure of Rhythm is Always Based on Linguistic Habits

SNL's TV shopping skit opening music ─── It's just ordinary, run-of-the-mill music, but pay attention to this rhythm. If you play this ordinary rhythm at a jam session in Tokyo, the drummer and bassist will fade out and stop.

This rhythm is what I call the triple offbeat-leading rhythm. It's a rhythm where the offbeat leads in all quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes, and Japanese speakers cannot recognize it. It has a tail-to-tail rhythm structure played in the order of 2345,6781 or 2341,2341 with sixteenth notes.

For Japanese people, it's the most advanced rhythm, but for Americans, it's just ordinary, lowbrow comedy theme music. This shows that the structure of rhythms we play unconsciously is always based on linguistic habits.

## GA and AAVE <!-- {#chat20250619} -->
<!-- 2025/06/19  -->

### Q What is GA consonants?
What is GA consonants?

### A

The term **“GA consonants”** isn’t a standard linguistic term on its own, but based on context, it likely refers to **consonants in General American (GA) English pronunciation**.

#### 🧠 What is GA?

**General American (GA)** is a widely accepted accent of American English often used as a standard in:

- Linguistics
- Speech training
- Dictionaries (for phonetic transcription)
- Broadcasting

It’s not tied to one geographic area but is common in the Midwest and West of the U.S., lacking strong regional features like Southern drawl or New York accent.

#### 🎙️ GA Consonants – What Does It Usually Mean?

It likely refers to how **consonants are realized (pronounced)** in General American English. For example:

| Consonant | Feature      | Example            | GA Trait                             |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| /t/       | Flapping     | _butter_ → [ˈbʌɾɚ] | [t] becomes [ɾ] between vowels       |
| /r/       | Rhotic       | _car_ → [kɑɹ]      | Fully pronounced /r/ even at the end |
| /l/       | Clear/Dark   | _leaf_ vs. _feel_  | Light [l] at start, dark [ɫ] at end  |
| /d/       | Flapping     | _ladder_ → [ˈlæɾɚ] | /d/ and /t/ often sound the same     |
| /ʔ/       | Glottal Stop | Rare in GA         | More common in Cockney, not GA       |

---

#### 🧩 If you meant something else by "GA consonants" — for example:

- GA = Georgia (language family, e.g., Georgian)
    
- GA = a specific phonology model abbreviation
    
- GA = a class name in a textbook
    

Let me know — I can reinterpret based on that.

| Perception         | Often stigmatized or misunderstood as “broken” English | Considered "neutral" or “standard”    |

### 🧾 Summary

| Area               | AAVE                                                   | GA                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Accent             | Distinct phonology (e.g., th-stopping, /r/-lessness)   | Rhotic, more conservative              |
| Grammar            | Habitual _be_, copula deletion, negative stacking      | Standard English grammar               |
| Style              | More expressive, rich oral traditions                  | More standardized in tone and rhythm   |
| Cultural grounding | Deeply rooted in African American history and identity | Tied to mainstream media and education |

If you're analyzing this for music, education, or rhythm theory (e.g., your _Tatenori_ framework), AAVE often aligns more with **stress-timed, rhythm-rich** prosody — much more than standard GA. It retains groove, reduction, and prosodic layering that Japanese learners might struggle with.

Let me know if you'd like:

- A side-by-side **audio** comparison
    
- Specific examples in **jazz**, **rap**, or **poetry**
    
- A breakdown of how **AAVE supports swing timing**, unlike Tatenori Japanese
